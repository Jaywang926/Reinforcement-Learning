1. Solving Blackjack Using Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
-    Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by obtaining cards that sum to greater than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21. Through Q-learning, the AI will learn the optimal strategy to maximize its winning probability.
2. Solving Frozen Lake Using Model Based Reinforcement Learning
-   The Frozen Lake is an environment on Gynasium involving crossing a frozen lake from start to goal without falling into the holes, moving one tile at a time. The player may not always move as intended due to the slippery nature of the frozen lake. Each move has a 1/3 probability of going in the intended direction, 1/3 probability of going left, and 1/3 of going right.
